        <div style="font-weight: bold;">Why Mechanical Engineering?</div>

        <p>I've always been a hands-on-practical-knowledge kinda guy. What I mean by this is, I like to actually perform activities rather than sit in a class and listen to theories all the time. So when I decided I wanted to do Engineering that's exactly what I thought it was all about. Little did i know that this thing was 80% theory and 20% practical. But over the years of being in college, coming across allot of different topics got me even more confused leaving me with too many options.
        </p>

        College turned out to be allot of fun though, 2 months into college I started a band along with 2 other friend's and we would play almost every day in one of the top-most places in Goa like Soro, W-hotel, Le-Meridian, Hardrock and so on. 
        Being a student for most people usually means little or no money, but when you’re working part time, you no longer have to worry about being able to afford the basic essentials or relying on your parents or student funding to get by. When you start making money of your own, you tend to become more cautious about how you spend your hard-earned cash. Going to classes, working a part-time job, socialising with friends and making time for your hobbies made for a busy schedule, but juggling so many different tasks also helped me improve my time management skills. Helped me become more organised and efficient with my time, I'd always have to plan ahead to ensure I can fit everything into the limited time I had.
        
     
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Life after Engineering</p>
        <div>
            I feel Engineering was not only about learning each and every math problem or knowing each and every physics formula, a great scientist once said,
            Quote: “I don't need to know everything, I just need to know where to find it, when I need it.”
           </div>
        I was confused for a long time as I didn't wanna do the typical Mechanical Engineering Job so I continued with Music and while I was at it I also got myself a sales and Marketing Job.
        
        One day my friend Reuben told me to try this level 0 boot-camp by Tanay Pratap, didn't think much of it at the time but after completing 2 lectures I realized that I was meant for this.
        If you read till here, I hope my life story has inspired you!
        If I can find my way, you can too! Cheers!
